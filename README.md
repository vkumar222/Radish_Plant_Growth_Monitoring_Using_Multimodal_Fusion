# Radish_Plant_Growth_Monitoring_Using_Multimodal_Fusion
Precision Agriculture uses advanced technologies like the Internet of Things, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning to
enhance crop quality and yield. Plant growth monitoring involves tracking changes in plant characteristics over time, such
as height, weight, and leaf area, to study the impact of environmental factors like light and temperature. This helps farmers
optimize growing conditions and detect diseases early
